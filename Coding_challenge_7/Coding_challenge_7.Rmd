```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

1.	4 pts. Read in the data called “PlantEmergence.csv” using a relative file path and load the following libraries. tidyverse, lme4, emmeans, multcomp, and multcompView. Turn the Treatment , DaysAfterPlanting  and Rep into factors using the function as.factor
STAND$Treatment <- as.factor(STAND$Treatment) # example shown here. 

```{r}
#load libraries

```



```{r}
#load data
datum <- read.csv("PlantEmergence.csv")
head(datum)

```





















2.	5 pts. Fit a linear model to predict Emergence using Treatment and DaysAfterPlanting along with the interaction. Provide the summary of the linear model and ANOVA results. 

3.	5 pts. Based on the results of the linear model in question 2, do you need to fit the interaction term? Provide a simplified linear model without the interaction term but still testing both main effects. Provide the summary and ANOVA results. Then, interpret the intercept and the coefficient for Treatment 2.

4.	5 pts. Calculate the least square means for Treatment using the emmeans package and perform a Tukey separation with the compact letter display using the cld function. Interpret the results.

5.	4 pts. The provided function lets you dynamically add a linear model plus one factor from that model and plots a bar chart with letters denoting treatment differences. Use this model to generate the plot shown below. Explain the significance of the letters.
