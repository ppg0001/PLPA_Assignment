#Data wrangling Practice
#We willbe playing wiht data manipulating them. With major focus on "tidyverse"

```{r Packages}
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)

```


```{r load data}

microbiome.fungi <- read.csv("Bull_richness.csv")
str(microbiome.fungi)

```

# Selecting certain columns
```{r}
#select funtion
#used Compartment:Fungicide because all these were in order and so can used the column to select them all.So it will select everything between comartment and richness.

microbiome.fungi2 <- select(microbiome.fungi, SampleID, Crop, Compartment:Fungicide, richness)

```


#Subsetting/filtering data (i.e., selecting certain rows)
```{r}
head(filter(microbiome.fungi2, Treatment == "Conv."))


# A more complex using &
head(filter(microbiome.fungi2, Treatment == "Conv." & Fungicide == "C"))

# Another more complex example using or |
head(filter(microbiome.fungi2, Sample == "A" | Sample == "B")) # samples A or B

```

# Creating a new column
#Mutate function
```{r}
# Create a new column called logRich
head(mutate(microbiome.fungi2, logRich = log(richness)))

# Creating a new column which combines Crop and Treatment 
head(mutate(microbiome.fungi2, Crop_Treatment = paste(Crop, Treatment)))

```

#The pipe (  %>%  )
#We can pipe data from other dataframe to another one
```{r}
microbiome.fungi %>%
  select(SampleID, Crop, Compartment:Fungicide, richness) %>% # selecting columns
  filter(Treatment == "Conv.") %>% # subsetting to only include the conventional treatment
  mutate(logRich = log(richness)) %>% # creating a new column of the log richness
  head() # displaying the first six rows

```

# Summarise data
# summarise() function to find things like means and standard deviations/errors.

```{r}
#Calculating mean for selected
microbiome.fungi %>%
  select(SampleID, Crop, Compartment:Fungicide, richness) %>% # selecting columns
  filter(Treatment == "Conv.") %>% # subsetting to only include the conventional treatment
  mutate(logRich = log(richness)) %>% # creating a new column of the log richness
  summarise(Mean.rich = mean(logRich)) # calculating overall mean log richness within the conventionally managed treatment



#We can also connect multiple summary statistics here.

microbiome.fungi %>%
  select(SampleID, Crop, Compartment:Fungicide, richness) %>% # selecting columns
  filter(Treatment == "Conv.") %>% # subsetting to only include the conventional treatment
  mutate(logRich = log(richness)) %>% # creating a new column of the log richness
  summarise(Mean.rich = mean(logRich), # calculating the mean richness, stdeviation, and standard error
            n = n(), 
            sd.dev = sd(logRich)) %>%
  mutate(std.err = sd.dev/sqrt(n))


#summary statistics by group 9Instead of filter we will use "group_by"

microbiome.fungi %>%
  select(SampleID, Crop, Compartment:Fungicide, richness) %>% # selecting columns
  group_by(Treatment, Fungicide) %>% # grouping by treatment and fungicide to later calculate summary stats by group
  mutate(logRich = log(richness)) %>% # creating a new column of the log richness
  summarise(Mean.rich = mean(logRich), # calculating the mean richness, stdeviation, and standard error
            n = n(), 
            sd.dev = sd(logRich)) %>%
  mutate(std.err = sd.dev/sqrt(n))



```

#Connecting to plotting
#we can add ggplot through pipe

```{r}
microbiome.fungi %>%
  select(SampleID, Crop, Compartment:Fungicide, richness) %>% # selecting columns
  group_by(Treatment, Fungicide) %>% # grouping by treatment and fungicide to later calculate summary stats by group
  mutate(logRich = log(richness)) %>% # creating a new column of the log richness
  summarise(Mean.rich = mean(logRich), # calculating the mean richness, stdeviation, and standard error
            n = n(), 
            sd.dev = sd(logRich)) %>%
  mutate(std.err = sd.dev/sqrt(n)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Fungicide, y = Mean.rich)) + # adding in a ggplot
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  geom_errorbar( aes(x=Fungicide, ymin=Mean.rich-std.err, ymax=Mean.rich+std.err), width=0.4) +
  theme_minimal() +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("Log Richness") +
  facet_wrap(~Treatment)



```

#Joining
# left_join() - Keep all rows of X and add matching rows from Y. Any rows in Y that donâ€™t match X are excluded.
# right_join() - reverse of left_join() -inner_join() - only keep rows that are common to both X AND Y, remove everything else.
# full_join() - Keep any columns that are in either X or Y

```{r}
# selecting just the richness and sample ID
richness <- microbiome.fungi %>%
  select(SampleID, richness)

# selecting columns that don't include the richness
metadata <- microbiome.fungi %>% 
  select(SampleID, Fungicide, Crop, Compartment, GrowthStage, Treatment, Rep, Sample)

head(metadata)
head(richness)


```


```{r}
head(left_join(metadata, richness, by = "SampleID")) # adding the richness data to the metadata based on on the common column of sampleID

```
#Pivoting
#Pivoting is also useful for converting from wide to long format and back again. We can do this with pivot_longer() and pivot_wider()

#As of now our data is in long format so we will use wide format function pivot_wider


```{r}
microbiome.fungi %>%
  select(SampleID, Crop, Compartment:Fungicide, richness) %>%
  group_by(Treatment, Fungicide) %>% # grouping by treatment and fungicide to later calculate summary stats by group
  summarise(Mean = mean(richness)) # calculates the mean per Treatment and Fungicide 


#Wide format - sets the values within the fungicide column into column names

microbiome.fungi %>%
  select(SampleID, Crop, Compartment:Fungicide, richness) %>% 
  group_by(Treatment, Fungicide) %>% # grouping by treatment and fungicide to later calculate summary stats by group
  summarise(Mean = mean(richness)) %>% # calculates the mean per Treatment and Fungicide 
  pivot_wider(names_from = Fungicide, values_from = Mean) # pivot to wide format


```

# Easily can take the difference bewteen the fungicide and control now.
```{r}
microbiome.fungi %>%
  select(SampleID, Crop, Compartment:Fungicide, richness) %>%
  group_by(Treatment, Fungicide) %>% # grouping by treatment and fungicide to later calculate summary stats by group
  summarise(Mean = mean(richness)) %>% # calculates the mean per Treatment and Fungicide 
  pivot_wider(names_from = Fungicide, values_from = Mean) %>% # pivot to wide format
  mutate(diff.fungicide = C - F) # calculate the difference between the means. 

```

#Now we can easily calculate the difference between fungicide and control and plot it.
```{r}
microbiome.fungi %>%
  select(SampleID, Crop, Compartment:Fungicide, richness) %>%
  group_by(Treatment, Fungicide) %>% # grouping by treatment and fungicide to later calculate summary stats by group
  summarise(Mean = mean(richness)) %>% # calculates the mean per Treatment and Fungicide 
  pivot_wider(names_from = Fungicide, values_from = Mean) %>% # pivot to wide format
  mutate(diff.fungicide = C - F) %>%  # calculate the difference between the means. 
  ggplot(aes(x = Treatment, y = diff.fungicide)) + # Plot it 
  geom_col() +
  theme_minimal() +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("Difference in average species richness")

```
